## MobileVision

This application uses the FaceDetection and TextRecognizer

Launch the application, you can then take a picture (use the front camera to get the text).
It will then draw a rectangle on the detected faces, add some circles on the Landmarks and show the text at the top of the screen.

It may not work in the emulator.
